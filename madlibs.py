The program will first prompt the user for a series of inputs a la Mad Libs.
For example, a singular noun, an adjective, etc. Then, once all the information has been
inputted, the program will take that data and place them into a premade story template.
 Youâ€™ll need prompts for user input, and to then print out the full story at the end with the input included.
